            <p class="pb-3 text">4. Keepsl Technologies LLP has developed, verified the results and provided the reports
                of
                back test
                results along with
                the trades generated. You are Solely Responsible for verifying the Accuracy of a trading strategy by
                carefully going
                through the trades generated during back tests. The quality of the platform’s analysis and optimization
                depends on past
                data modelling and has deviations from real time results owing to the nature of back testing and data
                provided by our
                vendors. After deployment, alerts or automated execution (“algorithmic trading”) have been made
                available on our
                platform to ease expedite your entry of the position, and you, as user of the system, are solely
                responsible for its
                usage. As such, you must carefully review all back test reports in all ways necessary to ensure their
                accuracy and
                fidelity. While there are other factors governing analysis and optimization accuracy, the quality of the
                platform’s
                outputs depends on the quality of data that we model.</p>
            <p class="pb-3 text">5. The trades generated by the Service may increase beyond what is practical to
                execute, due
                to broker
                execution limits and
                the difficulties in executing a complex trade in an all-or-none fashion. Moreover, once the trade is
                executed, the
                management of a complex trade becomes more difficult than is normally the case. Another factor is that
                you may not be
                authorized to execute all contract types found in the solutions generated. Keepsl Technologies LLP makes
                no
                representation that a solution generated by the Service can be executed and effectively monitored and
                managed in
                practice. It is entirely your responsibility to assess the appropriateness, suitability, and
                practicality of the
                solutions generated by the platform. It is your responsibility to ensure the trade is executable and
                manageable, and is
                appropriate for your needs.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="text pb-3">12. Past performance results are shown for illustration and example only, are
                hypothetical
                and as such have many
                inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve
                profits or losses
                similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently significant differences between hypothetical
                performance results
                and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading technique or methodology. One of
                the limitations
                of hypothetical performance results is that they are prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In
                addition, hypothetical
                trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for
                the impact of
                financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular
                trading program
                despite trading losses are material factors which can adversely affect actual trading results. There are
                numerous other
                factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which
                cannot be fully
                accounted for in a preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect
                actual trading
                results.
